1. The main language used on mumble and in the game is **Polish**. Do not add to the pickup queue if you are not comfortable with using Polish for the in-game communication.
2. _tf2pickup.pl_ was created with Team Fortress 2 **competitive gameplay** in mind.
3. _tf2pickup.pl_ is not the place to learn Team Fortress 2 competitive basics. It is expected of every player to know the 6v6 lineup as well as responsibilities of each class. One must also know the basics of the class they are going to play (i.e. rollout for soldiers or demo, healing order for medic, etc.).
4. **Mumble is obligatory**. Do not add to the pickup queue if you do not have the Mumble application installed and configured properly. Please make sure your voice is clear and audible.
5. Take the pickup matches seriously. Do not mess around and waste the game for the rest of players. **Ruining the pickup matches will be punished**.
6. Readying up for the pickup means you can play the entire 30 minutes of the match. Not joining the game, leaving the pickup mid-game or not being able to focus on the match will be punished.
    1. If you are forced to leave the game, find a substitute player for yourself and give him all the game details. Also, let your team know you are to be replaced.
7. **Swapping classes or teams is prohibited.** We want to avoid unbalanced matches so that playing the game is fun to everybody.
8. All forms of cheating, using alternate accounts and attempts to utilize unfair advantages against other players will be punished.
9. Bans will be given and taken down at the will of admins. There is no guarantee you will receive the same ban length for the same misbehaviour as the other player.
10. Unique weapons (a.k.a. unlocks) are a controversial matter, but abusing them is certainly not a profitable thing. Players are kindly asked to keep using unlocks at bay.
